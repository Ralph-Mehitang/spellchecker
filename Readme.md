#Hash-Tables
1. I followed the conventional algorithms that we talked about in class. The hash function was pretty tough at first but me and billy wokred togeter and got it figured out.
2.  My design choices were rather simple I pretty much followed the output directions that was included in the saple pdf.
3. Deficiency wise I was not able to finish my spellchecker (will come back and finish). I would make improvements to my hashing function because I think that I can get the time it takes to hash a lot more down.
